# Emotion Detection
### This script performs real-time emotion detection (by default) on faces using OpenCV and the DeepFace library. It captures video frames from a webcam or a pre-recorded video and detects faces in each frame. For each detected face, it analyzes the emotions and displays the dominant emotion and gender on the screen.

# To install required libraries
### pip install -r requirements.txt
